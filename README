DDDCPU16 - DeathlyDeep's DCPU16, a DCPU16 emulator.

=== SUMMARY ====================================================================

DDDCPU16 is a DCPU16 emulator written by Sylvain "DeathlyDeep" Boilard, student
at French IT engineer school EFREI, while he had way more urgent things to do.

The DCPU16 is an imaginary CPU designed by Markus "Notch" Personn for his
eventually-upcoming, nerd-friendly, space-exploration-and-stuff game "0x10c".

This project aims at:
 * Efficient DCPU16 emulation, at arbitrary speed and frequency.
 * Modular hardware system, using reentrant plugins.
 * And probably some sort of debug facilities, like GNU GDB's.

This project is targeted to terminals. Whereas the hardware plugins (like the
lem180x's) may use graphical facilities, the emulator itself will remain a
textual application.

I am not interested into Windows compatibility, but if you are, and want to be
involved in development, I will not refuse your patches. This said, I am
probably not going to use any fancy feature or library, so you should be able to
run this program as-is under Windows using Cygwin.

=== KNOWN BUGS =================================================================

DCPU16 interrupts
 * If the size of the interrupts queue grows longer than 256, the DCPU16
   processor is supposed to catch fire. Practically, this would lead to random
   words in the RAM getting randomly corrupted every once in a while, quickly
   ending up with chaotic behaviour.

   In DDDCPU16, instead of this, if the size of the queue reaches 256, the queue
   is considered emptied, and subsequent interrupts are then queued normally.
