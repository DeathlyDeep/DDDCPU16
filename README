================================================================================

DDDCPU16 is a DCPU16 emulator written by Sylvain "DeathlyDeep" Boilard, student
at French IT engineer school EFREI, while he had way more urgent things to do.

This project aims at:
 * Efficient DCPU16 emulation at arbitrary frequency.
 * Debug facilities, like GNU GDB's ones.
 * Modular hardware system (plugins).

This project is targeted to consoles. Whereas the hardware plugins may use
graphical facilities (like the lem1802), the emulator itself will remain a
textual application.

I am not interested into Windows compatibility, but if you are, and you want to
be involved in development, I will not refuse your patches.
