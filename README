DDDCPU16 - DeathlyDeep's DCPU16, a DCPU16 emulator.

=== SUMMARY ====================================================================

DDDCPU16 is a DCPU16 emulator written by Sylvain "DeathlyDeep" Boilard, student
at French IT engineer school EFREI, while he had way more urgent things to do.

The DCPU16 is an imaginary CPU designed by Markus "Notch" Personn for his
eventually-upcoming, nerd-friendly, space-exploration-and-stuff game "0x10c".

This software features efficient DCPU16 emulation, at arbitrary speed and
frequency, and a plugin system, mainly used for hardware emulation and
debugging. Currently (and when I am not too lazy) development efforts are
focused on the latter part. See the TODO part of this file.

=== USAGE ======================================================================

Synopsis:

  dddcpu16 [options...] ram_image

ram_image
    The content of this RAM image will be loaded into the RAM on the DCPU16 at
    the beginning of the emulation, and the execution will begin at address 0.
    You can generate this file by running a DASM16 assembler on a DASM16 source
    file, but DDDCPU16 does not provide such a tool.


Options:

The options are evaluated from left to right so, for example, if you set the
emulation speed twice, the second value will be recorded.

-s speed
    Select the speed of the emulation. Default is 1. Do not confuse with
    emulation frequency, which is a different value.

    This value can be a decimal value with up to 3 digits in the decimal part.
    For example, with a value of 0.125 , you will slow the emulation speed to
    1/8 of the normal behaviour.

-f frequency
    Select the frequency of the emulation. Default is 100kHz. Do not confuse
    with emulation speed, which is a different value.

    This value can be suffixed with Hz, kHz, MHz or GHz to indicate a value
    expressed in Hertz, kilo-Hertz, mega-Hertz or giga-Hertz. If no suffix is
    given, the value is considered to be in Hertz.

-p plugin [options...] [--]
    Load a plugin. You can pass options to the plugin by putting them after the
    plugin's name, and you can separate the plugin's options from the rest of
    the emulator's options with --. This is particularly useful when you want
    to load multiple plugins.

-B, -L
    Select desired endianness (Big or Little) for the ram image. Default is
    little endian.

-G granularity
    Select time granularity. The value can be suffixed with ms, us or ns to give
    a value in milli, micro or nano-seconds. If no suffix is added, the value is
    considered to be nanoseconds. This value can not be greater than 1 second.
    Default is 1 millisecond.

    This value represents the granularity of time for the emulation process. For
    example, with default values of frequency and speed, a granularity of 1
    millisecond means that, each millisecond,
      * 100 emulation cycles are performed.
      * If less than a millisecond passed, the emulator sleeps the time needed
        to match this delay.

    Doing this is necessary because the overhead of the sleep function is not
    negligible, and sleeping between each instruction would waste lots of
    resources. (This does not mean that the emulation timing is imprecise. The
    overhead of time of the sleep function and the overhead of cycles at the end
    of a chunk are compensated in the next chunk, leading to correct behaviour
    asymptotically.)

    If you need a smoother emulation, try to decrease this value. If you want to
    run the emulator at a high speed and/or frequency but end up using all of
    your computer's resources, try to increase it.

=== KNOWN BUGS =================================================================

DCPU16 catching fire.
 * The non-basic instruction 0x07 HCF (Hang Catch Fire) is not implemented.
 * If the size of the interrupts queue grows longer than 256, the DCPU16
   processor is supposed to catch fire. Practically, this would lead to random
   words in the RAM getting randomly corrupted every once in a while, quickly
   ending up with chaotic behaviour.

   In DDDCPU16, instead of this, if the size of the queue reaches 256, the queue
   is considered emptied, and subsequent interrupts are then queued normally.

=== TODO =======================================================================

Emulator
 * Implement a shared configuration system for the core emulator and plugins.
 * Events system
   * Allow arbitrary large number of simultaneous scheduled events.
   * Optimize events canceling.
 * Prevent drifting in emulation timing (none appears with default values, but
   it would be a good idea to do it eventually).
 * Allow arbitrary large command lines.

Plugins
 * Implement debug plugin.
 * Hardware
   * Implement lem1802.
   * Implement keyboard.
   * Implement sped-3.

General
 * A lot of stuff should probably be declared as 'versatile'.
 * Write documentation.
