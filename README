DDDCPU16 - DeathlyDeep's DCPU16, a DCPU16 emulator.

=== SUMMARY ====================================================================

DDDCPU16 is a DCPU16 emulator written by Sylvain "DeathlyDeep" Boilard, student
at French IT engineer school EFREI, while he had way more urgent things to do.

The DCPU16 is an imaginary CPU designed by Markus "Notch" Personn for his
eventually-upcoming, nerd-friendly, space-exploration-and-stuff game "0x10c".

This software feature efficient DCPU16 emulation, at arbitrary speed and
frequency, and will also feature a modular plugin system (for hardware
emulation, debugging, and so on). It is designed to perform efficiently into a
graphical environment, a framebuffer, or even a bare terminal if you do not care
about fancy display facilities, custom fonts and colors and stuff.

=== USAGE ======================================================================

Synopsis:

  ./dddcpu16 [options...] ram_image

Options:

-s speed
    Select the speed of the emulation. Default is 1. Do not confuse with
    emulation frequency, which is a different value.

-f frequency
    Select the frequency of the emulation. Default is 100kHz. Do not confuse
    with emulation speed, which is a different value.

    This value can be suffixed with Hz, kHz, MHz or GHz to indicate a value
    exprimed in Hertz, kilo-Hertz, mega-Hertz or giga-Hertz. If no suffix is
    given, the value is considered to be in Hertz.

-p plugin [options...] [--]
    Load a plugin. You can pass options to the plugin by putting them after the
    plugin's name, and you can separate the plugin's options from the rest of
    the emulator's options with --.

-B, -L
    Select desired endianness (Big or Little) for the ram image. Default is
    little endian.

-C granularity
    Select time granularity. The value can be suffixed with ms, us or ns to give
    a value in milli, micro or nano-seconds. If no suffix is added, the value is
    considered to be nanoseconds. Default is 1 millisecond.

    This value represents the granularity of time for the emulation process. For
    example, with default values of frequency and speed, a granularity of 1
    millisecond means that, each millisecond,
      * 100 emulation cycles are performed.
      * If less than a millisecond passed, the emulator sleeps the time needed
        to match this delay.

    Doing this is necessary because the overhead of the sleep function in not
    neglectible, and sleeping between each instruction would waste lots of
    ressources. (This does not mean that the emulation timing is imprecise. The
    overhead of time of the sleep function and the overhead of cycles at the end
    of a chunk are compensated in the next chunk, leading to correct behaviour
    asymptotically.)

    If you need a smoother emulation, try to decrease this value. If you want to
    run the emulator at a high speed and/or frequency but end up using all of
    your computer's ressources, try to increase it.

=== KNOWN BUGS =================================================================

DCPU16 interrupts
 * If the size of the interrupts queue grows longer than 256, the DCPU16
   processor is supposed to catch fire. Practically, this would lead to random
   words in the RAM getting randomly corrupted every once in a while, quickly
   ending up with chaotic behaviour.

   In DDDCPU16, instead of this, if the size of the queue reaches 256, the queue
   is considered emptied, and subsequent interrupts are then queued normally.

=== TODO =======================================================================

Emulator
 * Turn hardware system into a plugin system.

Plugins
 * Implement debug plugin.
 * Hardware
   * Implement lem180x.
   * Implement keyboard.
   * Implement clock.
   * Implement hmd2043.

General
 * Write documentation.
   * User documentation.
   * Developer documentation.
 * Test.
   * Fix bugs.
     * Test again.
